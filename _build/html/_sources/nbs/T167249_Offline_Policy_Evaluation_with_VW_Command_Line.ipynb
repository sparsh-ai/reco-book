        "VW implements several estimators to reduce policy evaluation to supervised learning-type evaluation. The simplest method, the direct method (DM), simply trains a regression model that estimates the cost (negative reward) of an (action, context) pair. As you might suspect, this method is generally biased, because the partial information problem means you typically see many more rewards for good actions than bad ones (assuming your production policy is working normally). Biased estimators should not be used for offline policy evaluation, but VW implements provably unbiased estimators like inverse propensity weighting (IPS) and doubly robust (DR) that can be used for this purpose."

Since they provide us a way to fill in fake rewards for untaken actions, they allow us to reduce bandit learning to supervised learning, and used to train policies. For example, say you have a (biased) DM estimator. For each untaken action per round, you can predict a reward, thus forming a supervised learning example where the loss of each action is known (estimated). You can then train an importance-weighted classification model, or even a regression model that estimates costs of arms given contexts, and use these models as policies. This is, in fact, what VW does: estimators serve a dual purpose and are used not only for evaluation, but also optimisation/training.\n",
